For example, I have a many to many relationship between my "Game" and "Property" models

I do not want to use the Relationship annotations for swift data models for a few reasons. I will have instead a 3rd model that will track these relationships -> "Relation" model. Also, I have a specific relation called 'platform' which shows the relation between two properties ( a system property and a format property specifically).

I need to be able to get the distinct games associated with a property.
I need to be able to get the platforms and non system/format properties for a game.

Example:
_________
Games
_________
Game1
Game2
Game3 

_________
Property
_________
Genre1
Genre2
Genre3
System1
System2
System3
Format1
Format2

_________
Relations
_________

Platform2 = System1 + Format1
Platform2 = System2 + Format1
Platform3 = System2 + Format2
Platform4 = System3 + Format1

Relation1 = Game1 + Genre1
Relation2 = Game1 + Genre2
Relation3 = Game1 + Platform2
Relation4 = Game1 + System1
